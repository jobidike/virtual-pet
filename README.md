virtual pet 

//Model VirtualPet class

First I started with instance variables, I made them private (integers) and they included: hunger, waste, boredom and tiredness.

Second I made the constructor, the constructors were public (integers) and also included: hunger, waste, boredom and tiredness.

Third I created the accessor method(getter) that included all my instance variables.

Next I created a tick() method that changed the game stats by using the +=/-= to increase and decrease the integer amounts.

//VirtualPetApp class

Firstly, I imported the scanner input into the main method and added values to the virtual pet tiger.

I used the website ascii.com to include a visual representation of my pet tiger.

I made a few print line statements welcoming the user to the virtual pet world.

I created a do while loop to make the game loop and included if else statements.

In the if else statments there are print line statements, the output for the menu, tick() method is in there and the game stats are also included.

Lastly, I closed the input.
